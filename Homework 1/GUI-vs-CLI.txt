The GUI (graphical user interface) is what most people are used to interacting with when it comes to computers. It’s all of the icons that you can double click to open up an application. It’s the files, windows, and menus that help organize everything for us. It’s the shortcuts we’re used to engaging with to get our devices to do what we want them to. It's how most people understand computers both interactively and visually. The CLI (command line interface) is everything behind the curtains so to speak. It’s nothing but text inputs and outputs visually. It’s far more complicated to use than a GUI but far more powerful. You have much more control with the CLI than you do with GUI. The funny thing with a CLI to me is how an extremely complex task can take the same amount of effort to perform on your end as a super simple task if they both can be completed in one line. The GUI is there to make computers more accessible and intuitive to use compared to a CLI. In a way the GUI is like the pedals, wheel, dashboard, buttons, and stick-shift of a car, and the CLI is like the engine, gears, tubes, and wires that you can’t see.

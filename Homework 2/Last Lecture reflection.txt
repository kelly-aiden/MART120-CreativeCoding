That lecture was incredible and very inspiring. Listening to a lecture that’s essentially the last lesson a man can give to his kids is a really good way to make me invested in the message he’s delivering. This being the one lecture that he believes sets his children, and anyone who listens for that matter, up to live a good life…wow. This was very powerful for me at this particular moment in my life. As I’ve mentioned in a few discussion posts I’ve recently switched to pursuing the arts. I still don’t have a super clear vision on what I want to do, but I have a passion and hunger to do SOMETHING. To be creative in a fulfilling and significant way, not just be someone who fades to the background, even if on a small scale. It is honestly pretty hard to be at the very VERY beginning stage of that process this late (relative to others) in my life most of the time. This lecture was extremely motivational and inspiring to hear right now. Everything he notes as positive rewards for his behavior (joy, connection, pride in others, love, success, etc.) are well intentioned and beautiful things, it’s the kind of things everyone should strive for. His joy and love and pride in others was really remarkable. He always saw the best on people, while being brutally honest when appropriate of course, and when those around him did great things he was not jealous of them, he was not threatened by them, he was proud of them and used it to motivate himself to be better too. That’s beautiful. One aspect that made this hit really hard for me was his joy, fulfillment, and hope even with death so close. That is like the ultimate “Hey here’s the most perfect evidence that this way of living yields good results” ever. His positivity, resilience, and work ethic are the 3 things that are really sticking with me in terms of characteristics I aspire to have to that level. He also showed off some super cool technological art that I had never really seen done before which was rad.

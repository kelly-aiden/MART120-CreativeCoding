Learning styles without a doubt effect how we learn. I know this with certainty because I’m a person who has different learning styles for different topics or subjects. If different earning styles affect my quality of learning between subjects then they absolutely affect different people differently. I learn history much better if it’s told to me like stories or tales, it makes it easier for me to remember it as a narrative with plot points and characters (protagonists, side characters, antagonists, etc). For concepts I’m all about videos or art. I’m someone who can see colors and patterns and say “that looks like the way I feel when I get up in the morning and go to get milk for my cereal and we’re out” so tying together visuals to convey concepts and emotions and themes is super helpful for me. Generally adding relevant and additive additional stimuli to a thing, the better I understand it (it’s why I hate reading and writing, it’s SOOO boring). For skills (math, drawing, dancing, coding, etc.) I am without a doubt a learn by doing kind of person. You can explain it a 100 times, you can do it in front of me over and over again, but until I do it and fail and experiment and learn, it will not stick. What’s tricky is that everyone is completely different in their preferred learning styles. For example, my two best friends love reading books, they’re burning through at least one a month. Me, on the other hand, will under no circumstances read a book without cool comic book pictures covering the page.
